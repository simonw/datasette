"We need to increase the background size of 7 photos.<br /><br />
We are helping a local church with some image editing and need 7 photos retouched.<br /><br />
The idea is to increase the size of the golden background to ensure there is enough space for the bleed when the image is printed.<br /><br />
The image of the saint needs to stay the same but the background needs to increase in size by 20%.<br /><br />
Please see one image attached and let me know if you can complete the job in 24 hours.<br /><br />

"Hi there,<br /><br />
I have currently developed a variety of different planners (16 to be exact) that are all extremely similar in design and templatized with minor variations in colour and text inside.<br /><br />
I am looking for an experienced graphic designer who is familiar with designing digital daily/weekly planners from the ground up and all that it entails.<br /><br />
The design for my digital daily/weekly planners are completed. The only things I need from this project are creating appropriate text boxes in the right locations so a user can fill it in like a digital planner.<br /><br />
I am also updating some of the text in certain areas, so I need someone who can swap in and out the text in certain fields.<br /><br />
I am looking for a quick turn around here as all the design work is down, it just needs to function correctly and look good on all devices (computer, tablets, phone etc)<br /><br />
Whilst this job is small, I am also looking to hire someone long term if this project is successful with a designer who is communicative, hard working and creative.<br /><br />

"Hello,<br /><br />
I am looking for someone to help on a very tight deadline project today, tomorrow, and Friday. The project itself is not super complicated but it is very critical that you are able to work on USA time so we can communicate about the project. Some details:<br /><br />
I have 3 software demo videos that need to be cleaned up and edited down into 2 shorter cuts (2min and 4min) - we essentially need to take the 3 recordings and make &amp;quot;highlight reels&amp;quot; out of them - they will not have sounds or text on them as they will be playing on a loop on a screen at an event. The 2 videos will basically be the same just 1 is longer than the other so it will show more. <br /><br />
There will be some small branding elements to add but nothing crazy. <br /><br />
When we have a contract in place I will need to use email and whatsapp to send you the assets (this is not against Upwork terms of use if we have a contract in place). <br /><br />
If you can start on this right now, please respond and include the word &amp;quot;tree&amp;quot; in your response so I know you read this. <br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $200

"Spirit of Giving Screen Saver<br /><br />
Computer Museum of America has a temporary exhibit space; we call it the &amp;quot;Nook Look&amp;quot; It changes every 2-3 months. It has a 72&amp;quot; TV installed at the top, which annoumces the current exhibit. Attaching a picture of it.&amp;quot;Nook Look Video Format Stretched<br />
.jpg&amp;quot;<br />
 We need a quick event graphic featuring the title graphic &amp;quot;From the CMoA Collection: ROBOTs&amp;quot; It is really between a motion graphic and a static graphic- is not meant to compete with the exhibit, but we don&#039;t want to burn a static image into the monitor, so we set it up as a powerpoint made of 10-15 jpegs which have the title and background imagery that slowly fades from one to the next. Then we export that as video and loop it on the monitor However, you need not use power point- you can use any graphics software that will export to 4K video<br /><br />
The graphic will be displayed on a 9:16 monitor in 4K. To keep the screen from being &#039;burned in&#039; from a static image being displayed for too long, the graphic you create should have a variety of different color schemes that can fade from one to the next. You will set these up to cross-fade slowly. <br /><br />
Attached is &amp;quot;4K Video LoveBytes&amp;quot; a previous exhibit&#039;s logo/screen saver graphic to give you an idea of the desired pace of the cross fading. <br /><br />
Important - transition between slides should be slow- it should be readable at all times, but change often enough that it never burns into the screen<br /><br />
Deliverables: a 120&nbsp;&nbsp;second video with&nbsp;&nbsp;12-15 screen changes using the supplied logo, arranged in a powepoint. Use slow fades between slides like the example supplied<br /><br />
Our standard fonts are Aglet Slab Pro and Ropa Mix Pro. I am also attaching our standard colors - we like to stick to black, white and grays for these headers but can add splashes of color occasionally for accent. We also have a graphic pattern established- the digital pattern,&nbsp;&nbsp;which has been placed in the attached file 4K NookLook TV Template.ai<br /><br />

"Hi!<br /><br />
I am looking for expertise and support to create a print on demand store. I have loosely explored the Etsy shop front, the Printful platform, Affinity designer software, Canva and some websites that sell graphics that can be used to create and sell designs.<br /><br />
While I have bits and pieces of information about how to open a store and the importance of having a niche and investigating trends, I am limited in my experience with using the tools required for this and developing creative, unique designs.<br /><br />
My foundation idea thus far is to sell products aimed at the education sector. I have been considering either printables aimed at teachers that can be used in their classrooms or products that parents can buy to gift their children&#039;s teachers. I&#039;d like my store/products to have a consistent, appealing theme/aesthetic. I personally like more minimalistic designs.<br /><br />
Aside from other things that may be outside of my scope of knowledge at this point in the process, I&#039;m looking someone to:<br /><br />
*share expertise to help decide on a niche/theme/product range based on data<br />
*share their knowledge and help me become proficient in using the necessary websites to successfully run my store: Etsy, Printful, Shopify, design software/Canva, etc<br />
*collaborate with me and listen to my ideas to create a consistent aesthetic for the products I sell<br />
*make designs and start to put products in my store, as a kind of &#039;spring board&#039; for me to continue from<br />
*share marketing strategies and SEO/keyword support<br />
*leave me with a &#039;tool kit&#039; that I can use to continue to create and expand my product range: colour palette, knowledge and proficiency in necessary platforms/software, how/where to track trend data, etc<br />
*provide some ongoing support for a period after the launch of my store<br /><br />
I understand that a of people are out there looking to open these stores at the moment. While my knowledge is limited, I would like to approach this sensibly from the start and set myself up for success. I am looking for someone patient and communicative. I&#039;d like to work with someone who is open to taking on ideas but not afraid to share their own.<br /><br />

"---Scope updated at 10 AM PDT: Number of people and time of day are confirmed---<br /><br />
Hello! I am a creative director for ENGIE Impact based in Spokane, Washington, USA, and I&#039;m coordinating a corporate headshot photoshoot on June 1, 1:00-3:00 PM CET, for 14 leaders in our Paris office, located at 1 Samuel de Champlain Square, Courbevoie, 92400.<br /><br />
---Environment/Set Up---<br />
The photoshoot will be in a large meeting room with as many windows as possible but a lighting kit will be required. We will also need a white or light gray backdrop. As a sustainability company, we like to have greenery in the background (see examples) but this is optional.<br /><br />
---Persons---<br />
We need headshots for 1 Executive (Mark) and 13 senior leaders = 14 total required people. If other employees invite themselves to the photoshoot, how should we handle the extra time/photos? Please provide two separate cost estimates for these scenarios.<br /><br />
---Deliverables---<br />
For Mark: Mark is our newest executive so we&#039;d like to capture his headshot, then Photoshop the background to match the rest of the executives (see https://www.engieimpact.com/leadership). See also: the attached examples where we Photoshopped the background of the CHRO. We prefer for the photographer to capture Mark with a plain white background and deliver two, high-resolution images of two different poses so that the in-house graphic design team can Photoshop the background.<br /><br />
For all other employees: Deliver one edited photo per person. During the photoshoot, is it possible to show each person their shots so they can select one for editing?<br /><br />
---Logistics---<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Date/time confirmed: June 1, 1:00-3:00 PM CET<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- My Paris-based team member will be available onsite for the day-of coordination<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Security check and badge access required for the building, TBD if a freight elevator is required<br /><br />
---<br />
In your cover letter, please tell me about your processes, any recommendations for the best execution, and price options. Before selecting a freelancer, I may ask for a phone call. I am available as early as 7:00 AM PDT / 4:00 PM CET.<br /><br />

"Title: Designer Needed for Brand Refresh, Art File Updates, and Web Design<br /><br />
Description:<br />
I am seeking a talented designer to assist me with a brand refresh for my company, as well as update various art files including the logo, business card, and stationery (letterhead, envelope, notecard, and notecard envelope). The deliverables should include digital file templates in Word and PowerPoint formats, along with files required for printer production.<br /><br />
Once the art assets are completed, I will also require assistance with web design and development for a 5-page (or more) website. The website should be built on a platform that allows for easy content updates, as I will be working separately on copywriting. While I do not have a specific platform preference, it&#039;s important that the website serves as a portal for high-level communications and marketing about Docent Partners&mdash;a &amp;quot;boutique investment firm.&amp;quot; The website should showcase our identity, overall value proposition, types of business engagements and services we offer, and feature case studies of our previous work. Additionally, I plan to link to another website that will focus on regular content generation, some of which will be behind a paywall. I would appreciate guidance on integrating these two websites seamlessly.<br /><br />
Please review the original brand assets from 5 years ago, which can be accessed through this link (Adobe files provided). Kindly note that the business name and structure have changed. Previously, it was known as Docent Investment Management &amp;amp; Docent Capital, but it is now officially called Docent Partners (LLC). Within Docent Partners, there are two subsidiary businesses&mdash;Docent Capital and Docent Advisors&mdash;each serving different engagements based on specific projects. In terms of the website&#039;s branding and communications, the primary focus should be on the foundational elements of Docent Partners, explaining our partnership model and approach, which involves an open architecture of third-party advisors brought in as needed for different projects. Separate pages should be created for Docent Capital and Docent Advisors. If my vision is not clear, I will provide further clarification once we begin working on the project. The ultimate goal is to present the brand in a cohesive manner across all sub-entities, despite offering distinct services.<br /><br />
If you are an experienced designer who can handle this project, please submit your portfolio showcasing relevant work samples along with your proposal. Additionally, please include an estimated timeline and your pricing details. I look forward to discussing the project further with qualified candidates.<br /><br />

"Hello! I am looking for a Keynote expert to design slides for an upcoming non-profit organization&#039;s fundraiser event this weekend.<br /><br />
I have slides from the client that are currently in PPT and I want to design them based on the event branding. I have a Keynote file to start designing from. The client&#039;s fonts includes fonts from Adobe Fonts, so having Adobe CC is essential.<br /><br />
Looking for someone to begin working on this as soon as possible &mdash; ideally today.<br /><br />
I am hiring for this initial project now, but I am also looking for a talented Keynote designer to work with for future projects as well.<br /><br />
Please let me know your rate. Looking forward to hearing from you!<br /><br />
Thanks,<br />
