    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Canvas Store Website Development  - Upwork]]></title>
    <updated>2023-05-18T04:28:38+00:00</updated>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, <br /><br />
We operate a business called Premier Canvas TT where we sell uniquely design collages on canvas - https://instagram.com/premiercanvastt?igshid=MzNlNGNkZWQ4Mg==<br /><br />
ORDER PROCESS<br />
Currently this is the order process of the business <br /><br />
1. Clients send 1-7 images that they want designed into a photo collage via WhatApp.<br /><br />
2. Customer select their canvas size from our list of sizes. Each size starting from small to large have a different cost <br /><br />
3. A 50% deposit is done via bank (no cash on delivery only bank transfer accepted). Once the deposit is made, the Customer sends their name, address for delivery and contact # via Whatsapp <br /><br />
4. Customer send proof of payment <br /><br />
5. Our designer create the picture collage using their photos and send it to the customer for approval. This is done within 24-48 hours<br /><br />
6. Customer approves and we proceed with printing the collage design on the canvas. The end product is delivered to the customers address within 5 working days<br /><br /><br />
CHALLENGES<br />
1. Repetition: Each customer ask the same questions. _*How can I place an order, how many pictures can I do on the collage, what are your available sizes, how much does it cost, can I pay on delivery, what is your payment options, how long does it take to get my order*_<br /><br />
2. Whatsapp reduces the quality of images. We want the website to collect the images by allowing the customer to upload one or more images and select their canvas size and proceed to checkout.<br /><br />
3. At the end of the checkout we want to collect the customer name, contact number and address for delivery. We want the customer to be presented with our bank account information and then automatically redirected to WhatsApp with an automated msg sent from our Whatsapp business number to the customer contact number stating *Thank you for ordering. Once your deposit is made, please send us a screenshot of your 50% deposit to get started&amp;quot;<br /><br />
.<br />
.<br />
WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE?<br /><br />
To fully automate the order process as best as we can. To make the website clear and easy to understand by the use of text and graphics. We also want to encourage customers to send us reaction videos when the present(canvas is gifted to someone) in return customer can earn a discount of up to 75% on their next order.<br /><br />
WHO IS THE IDEAL DEVELOPER?<br /><br />
Someone who is skilled with development but also good with graphic design. We need all the graphics to be tailor made to suit our business. We want clear, easy to understand, descriptive graphics depicting the order process from start to finish. Text will be provided. <br /><br />

WHAT PLATFORM SHOULD IT BE DEVELOPED?<br /><br />
We are okay with customer build, WordPress or shopify. Anything that would work well for our requirements<br /><br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $400

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,<br /><br />
I have currently developed a variety of different planners (16 to be exact) that are all extremely similar in design and templatized with minor variations in colour and text inside.<br /><br />
I am looking for an experienced graphic designer who is familiar with designing digital daily/weekly planners from the ground up and all that it entails.<br /><br />
The design for my digital daily/weekly planners are completed. The only things I need from this project are creating appropriate text boxes in the right locations so a user can fill it in like a digital planner.<br /><br />
I am also updating some of the text in certain areas, so I need someone who can swap in and out the text in certain fields.<br /><br />
I am looking for a quick turn around here as all the design work is down, it just needs to function correctly and look good on all devices (computer, tablets, phone etc)<br /><br />
Whilst this job is small, I am also looking to hire someone long term if this project is successful with a designer who is communicative, hard working and creative.<br /><br />
If you feel you fit the description, please do apply here.<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $200

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Need to make up/design a poster for an academic lecture. The text (title, place, participants, etc) is in simplified Chinese, so you have to master Chinese fonts.<br /><br />
Format A4 is enough (to be spread online, no printing required). <br /><br />
We provide: an illustration, logos, text info in a word document (Chinese title, time, location, list of participants to add on the poster). The illustration has to be used with some design or effects, not directly pasted (I.e. part of it, transparency ,visual effects&hellip; anything to make the poster looks great). <br /><br />
It&rsquo;s a 24h job, the earlier if (of course) the best!<br /><br />
I will provide a poster draft (see sample attached) to arrange the text layers and the 2 logos.<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $30
